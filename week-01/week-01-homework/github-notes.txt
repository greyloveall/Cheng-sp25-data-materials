I think the words "fork" and "clone" are quite interesting. First of all, regarding "fork", I would immediately think of the scene of eating. But I don't understand why it is called "fork" in GitHub. Maybe it's because my English is not good enough. Next, regarding "clone", I think it is also a very interesting word. I would first think of the cloned people in science fiction movies.
